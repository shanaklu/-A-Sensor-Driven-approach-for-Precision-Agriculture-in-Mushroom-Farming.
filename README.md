# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# -A-Sensor-Driven-approach-for-Precision-Agriculture-in-Mushroom-Farming.
A React Native–based mobile app integrating sensors and machine learning for precision agriculture in mushroom farming

# 🍄 Sensor-Driven Precision Agriculture for Mushroom Farming

This project implements a smart farming solution that combines **real-time sensor data**, **Arduino-based monitoring**, and a **React Native mobile application** to support precision agriculture in mushroom cultivation. 

🌿 The goal is to monitor and optimize environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and CO₂ levels using sensor networks and provide real-time insights to farmers through a mobile interface.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- React Native (Mobile Frontend)
- Python (Data Processing / Machine Learning)
- Arduino (Sensor Integration)
- Firebase or Local Storage (optional for data)

## 🎯 Features
- Real-time environment monitoring
- Sensor data visualization on mobile
- Intelligent alerts and recommendations
- Open-source and customizable for other crops

## 📦 Project Status
Final year research project – actively maintained and open for collaboration!
